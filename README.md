## Tech stack

- **Framework:** Next.js 15 / React 19
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS v4
- **Forms & validation:** React Hook Form + Zod

## Key flows

- **Glass claim (`/ny-skada/glas`)**: Select company, proceed through steps (`Step1`â€“`Step4`) with validation (`validationSchema.js`), upload photos, sign, and submit. On success, an email is sent using the server action in `app/actions/send-email.js` with the React Email template in `emails/send-email.jsx`.
- **Key claim (`/ny-skada/nyckel`)**: Mirrors the glass flow with its own multi-step wizard and validation.

## Notes

- Uses Supabase (data/auth) and Resend (email).
- Private project.
